Small rust program to compute 1- and 2-electron integrals as well as restricted Hartree Fock energies. 

Build with `cargo build` and run with `cargo run`. 

Current main function requires manual specification of Gaussian functions to include and nuclear coordinates. Future commits may create functionality to read `xyz` files and formatted basis set inputs.
